# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Technologies
### Express
Express is a Node.js web application framework used to manage the server.

### Mongoose
Mongoose is a JavaScript OOP library used to connect between MongoDB and the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment, and model application data with schema-based solutions. 

### ESLint
ESLint is a pluggable linting utility used to find errors and maintain code consistency.

### Prettier
Prettier is a code formatter used to tidy up the code. 

## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
